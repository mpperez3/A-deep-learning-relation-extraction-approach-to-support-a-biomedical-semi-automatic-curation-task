# A-deep-learning-relation-extraction-approach-to-support-a-biomedical-semi-automatic-curation-task
Discover relevant biomedical interactions in the literature is crucial for enhancing biology research. It has an essential role in studying the different processes and interactions reported that affect the biological process (e.g., genome, metabolome, and transcriptome). Therefore, the objective of this work is twofold: reduce the manual effort required to curate and review the existing biochemical interactions reported in the gluten-related bibliome while proposing a novel relation extraction deep learning approach that assists in a real curation task by learning from the previous decisions of the curators.
